Project: Personal Expense Tracker (with Dynamic Typing & GUI)
🔹 Project Overview:
Create a desktop application using Tkinter (or PyQt if you want a more advanced UI) that allows users to log, categorize, and analyze their expenses.
🔹 Key Features:
Add Expenses: Users enter an amount, category (e.g., food, transport, entertainment), and date.
Dynamic Typing in Action: Handle various input types dynamically (e.g., float for amounts, str for categories, datetime for dates).
View Expense History: Display logged expenses in a table.
Data Persistence: Save and load expenses using a CSV file or SQLite database.
Expense Summary & Charts: Use Matplotlib to generate visual charts for spending trends.
Budget Alerts: If spending in a category exceeds a threshold, show a warning.
Simple UI: Use Tkinter (for simplicity) or PyQt (for a more modern look).
🔹 Tech Stack:
Python 🐍
Tkinter / PyQt (GUI)
Pandas (for data handling)
Matplotlib (for charts)
SQLite / CSV (for storing expenses)
🔹 Suggested Enhancements:
🔸 Dark Mode Toggle – Switch between dark/light themes.
🔸 Export to Excel/PDF – Allow users to export their expenses.
🔸 Monthly Analysis – Show spending trends over time.
